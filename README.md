# score-events

A Clojure library designed to have some fun with core.async.

## Usage

In this project we will be logging and scoring Github events.  

The events are generated by the EventTicker component in the event-ticker namespace.

To kick the process off, call `core.start-system`, passing in a core.async channel. Events will be put on that channel as they are generated.

## Goals
- Use component to start and stop the system.
- Compute aggregate scores for each github user, using the table provided below.
- Display users' github score in a web-page.

## Stretch Goals 

- Live updates in browser
- Replace mock event source with actual Github event source.
- Add persistence layer
- User session management


## Event scoring

Events are scored based on this table.  

| Event Type | Points |
|------------|---|
| PushEvent  | 5 |
| PullRequestReviewCommentEvent | 4 |
| WatchEvent  | 3 |
| CreateEvent | 2 |
| Every other event | 1 |
