# score-events

A Clojure library designed to have some fun with core.async.

## Usage

In this project we will be logging and scoring events.  

The events are generated by the EventTicker component in the event-ticker namespace.

To kick the process off, call core.start-system, passing in a channel. Events will be put on that channel as they are generated.

## The Goal

Events are scored based on this table.  

| Event Type | Points |
|------------|---|
| PushEvent  | 5 |
| PullRequestReviewCommentEvent | 4 |
| WatchEvent  | 3 |
| CreateEvent | 2 |
| Every other event | 1 |
